# MachineLearning
Here is my Python jupyter source file containing code used to analyse big data and conduct machine learning for predictive outputs. 

The project leverages Apache Spark and Apache Spark's Machine Learning Library to process the data and train several ML models.

The first section (Part A) of the project analyses crime data recorded from three counties. The data is processed using Apache Spark and Spark SQL Optimiser tools. With a much cleaner dataset, I generated clear graphical insights which display trends in the data. 
The second section (Part B) showcases my skills in utilising Pyspark ML Lib to generate predictions for loan candidates based on their inputted features. The dataset is pre-processed to ensure missing or NULL data is dealt with, whilst minimising outliers by applying minmax scaling. The dataset is then split into training and testing data, and applied to Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes Machine Learning models. 
An evaluation showcasing accuracy metrics as well as confusion matrices for each model’s performance can be found towards the end of the file.
